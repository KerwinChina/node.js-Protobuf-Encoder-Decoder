# Node.js Protobuf Encoder and Decoder

This project provides a simple yet efficient way to encode and decode messages using Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) in Node.js applications. It leverages the streaming capabilities of Node.js to handle data serialization and deserialization, making it well-suited for applications that require fast and efficient network communication.

## Features

- **Efficient Encoding and Decoding**: Uses Protocol Buffers, a method of serializing structured data, for efficient data encoding and decoding.
- **Stream-Based Processing**: Takes advantage of Node.js streams to process data in a non-blocking way.
- **Easy Integration**: Can be easily integrated into existing Node.js applications that require protocol-based communication.

## Installation

Before you start, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. This project also requires the `protobufjs` package for handling Protobuf messages.

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KerwinChina/node.js-Protobuf-Encoder-Decoder
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd node.js-Protobuf-Encoder-Decoder
```

3. Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

To use the encoder and decoder, you first need to define your Protobuf messages. Refer to the [Protocol Buffers documentation](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) for how to define your `.proto` files.

After defining your Protobuf messages, you can use the encoder and decoder as follows:

```javascript
const { ProtocolEncoder, ProtocolDecoder } = require('./path/to/encoder/decoder');

// Example: Encoding a message
const encoder = new ProtocolEncoder();
const encodedMessage = encoder.encode({ /* message data */ });

// Example: Decoding a message
const decoder = new ProtocolDecoder();
const message = decoder.decode(encodedMessage);
```
